        "The main purpose of the study is to contrast the assumptions of two theoretical frameworks on gender roles acquisition: gender schema theory and social cognition. Thus, we have identified the following research aims and hypotheses to fulfill the previous general purpose and to address the research question.  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Aim 1: Determine if gender schema theory or social cognition theory assumptions about gender roles and sexist beliefs stand. In this sense, we predict that individuals with traditional gender schemas or with a traditional gender role distribution in their upbringing household will present stronger associations to sexist beliefs and gender roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Aim 2: Identify the type of relationship that gender schema theory and social cognition theory play in determining the process of gender roles and sexist beliefs acquisition. For this aim, we have developed two contrasting exploratory hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "  First, we hypothesize that the relationship between gender and sexist beliefs is mediated by the sequential effect of observational learning and gender schema. In this case, the process of identification with a gender schema will be a consequence of observational learning, which in turn, will determine the level of association with sexist beliefs and gender roles acquisition. In this first exploratory hypothesis, we predict that individuals with a traditional gender role distribution in their upbringing household are more likely to develop traditional gender schemas, which in turn, will lead to stronger sexist beliefs and traditional gender roles perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Second, we hypothesize that the relationship between gender and sexist beliefs is mediated by a parallel effect of observational learning and gender schema. So contrary to our first hypothesis, we are assuming that the process of identification with a gender schema is independent from observational learning of traditional gender roles, but that together, both factors may increase the likelihood of gender roles and sexist beliefs acquisition. Our prediction in this second exploratory hypothesis is that individuals with a traditional gender role distribution in their upbringing household and who developed traditional gender schemas will have stronger sexist beliefs and more traditional gender roles perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Aim 3: Explore if identity salience has a moderating effect on the relationship between gender and sexist beliefs. As such, we predict that individuals who consider their gender identification as a key determinant of their personal identity to have stronger sexist beliefs and more traditional gender roles perceptions.\n"

        "\n",
        "* Precarious Manhood Beliefs (*Precarious_manhood_1/4*): Precarious manhood beliefs relate to the conception of manhood as elusive, uncertain, a matter of struggle, and something to be constantly proven (Vandello et al., 2008). As such, holding greater precarious manhood beliefs is associated with greater perceptual levels of sexism.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset included 4 items from the Precarious Manhood Beliefs (PMB) scale (Vandello et al., 2023) that conveyed beliefs that manhood is difficult to earn and easy to lose.

        "* Collective Action Intentions to Support Gender Equality (*Collective_action_intentions_normative1/2, Collective_action_intentions_radical1/2, Collective_action_intentions_normative_long_1/6*): According to Social Dominance Theory, individuals with sexist beliefs is a reflection of holding hierarchy-enhancing ideologies, which in turn, increases their motivations to act in ways that perpetuate gender inequalities (Stewart, 2017; Sidanius and Pratto, 1999).\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset assessed the participants' intention to engage in collective behaviors for gender equality by including 4 items from the radical group behavior scale (Tausch et al., 2011) and 6 items from the environmental action scale (Alisat and Reimer, 2015). (Scale from 1 to 7, 1 being \"not likely at all\" and 7 being \"very likely\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Zero-Sum Perspective of Gender Status (*ZeroSum_GenderPerspective_1/7*): This factor is based on the general zero-sum concept that argues that people hold a cognitive bias called fixed-pie bias that entails that one's interests will be opposed to the interests of others (Davidai and Tepper, 2023). In this context, zero-sum gender beliefs correspond to the perception that the interests, profits, and actions of women will negatively affect the one's of men, creating a comprehension of win-lose social interaction between men and women.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset combined items from two scales to examine participants' zero-sum beliefs about gender status. It included all six items of the Zero-Sum Perspective on Gender Status Scale (Ruthig et al., 2017), which assessed zero-sum beliefs six domains (e.g., family, politics, occupational), and a single item that examines zero-sum gender beliefs over discrimination (Scale from 0 to 5, 0 being \"strongly disagree\" and 5 \"strongly agree\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ambivalent Sexism (*AmbivalentSexism_1/6*): Ambivalent sexism theory considers that sexism embodies two possible forms of social interactions between men and women. One is the reflection of hostility toward women (hostile sexism), and another that associates with behaviors and attitudes that are stereotypically against women but that are subjectively positive in feeling tone, and often are mistaken as prosocial or intimacy-seeking behaviors (benevolent sexism) (Glick and Fiske, 1996).\n",
        "\n",
        "  To measure ambivalent sexism, the dataset includes 3 items to assess benevolent sexism and 3 more for hostile sexism from the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Rollero et al., 2014). (Scale from 0 to 5, 0 being \"strongly disagree\" and 5 \"strongly agree\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ambivalence toward Men (*Ambivalence_toward_men_1/6*): Ambivalence toward men offers the opposite perceptual position of Ambivalence Sexism. It refers to those attitudes that characterize men as either controlling, condescending, and likely to sexually harass (hostility toward men), or as protectors, providers, and who should be taken care of by women (benevolence toward men) (Glick and Whitehead, 2010).\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset included six items from the Ambivalence toward Men Inventory (Glick and Whitehead, 2010), 3 items that measure Hostility toward Men, and 3 more for Benevolence toward Men. (Scale from 0 to 5, 0 being \"strongly disagree\" and 5 \"strongly agree\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Gender essentialism (*GenderEssentialism_1/3*): Holding gender essentialist beliefs refers to the perception that there are innate differences (Heyman and Giles, 2006; Gelman, 2003), and that these differences are what determine the assignment of gender roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "  To examine the presence of gender essentialist beliefs among the participants, the dataset included five items from the Gender Essentialism Scale (Skewes et al., 2018) (Scale from 1 to 7, 1 being \"strongly disagree\" and 7 being \"strongly agree\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Power Distance Beliefs (*PowerDistanceBeliefs_1/4*): This factor is defined as the degree of power disparity that people in a culture expect and accept (Hofstede, 2001, in Kim and Zhang, 2014). Thus, it has been determined that one of the characteristics of ambivalent sexism involves protecting men's power dominance position with respect to women, and such will show greater support for power distance beliefs (Ratliff et al., 2017 in Cross et al., 2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "  To analyze the prevalence of power distance beliefs, the dataset contains four items from Brockner et al. (2001), which focus on assessing attitudes about societal ranks, salary increases, questioning authority decisions, and formal communication with superiors. (Scale from 1/7, 1 being \"strongly disagree\" and 7 being \"strongly agree\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Autonomy and Embeddedness Values (*Autonomy_1/5, Embeddedness_1/5*): Holding autonomy values poses as opposites to communal preferences or embeddedness values, which emphasize the importance of belonging to a social group and adherence to its norms and values. Thus, autonomy values are associated with more individualistic perceptions and attitudes that promote independence and development of the self (Proudfoot and Kay, 2022). In this sense, stronger embeddedness values aid in the reinforcement of sexist beliefs as part of the collective representations of social interactions. Whereas stronger autonomy values are more likely to contest the status quo of sexist beliefs.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The dataset uses the adapted autonomy vs embeddedness scale by Vignoles et al. (2016), which contains 10 items: 5 measuring autonomy values and the rest for embeddedness values. (Scale from 1-6, 1 being \"not at all like me\" and 6 being \"a lot like me\") (Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2024).\n",

After creating the factor composites, the structure of the final dataset has 24,303 observations and 27 variables. Most of these variables are numeric or ordinal.

This means that as you identify more with a masculine gender schema, you will identify less with a feminine gender schema. According to the gender schema theory, we would expect this relationship between gender schemas, since they are considered opposites. Derived from the latter finding, we have determined to use the composite of gen.schema for the subsequent analysis. This variable offers the full range of the gender schema identification with positive values (>0) reflecting a more masculine identity and negative values (<0) a more feminine identity."

In this sense, by applying the PCA model, we decreased the dimensionality of our data from 57 variables to 52 principal components. Thus, this confirms the finding observed in the correlation analysis. The variables in the dataset are weakly correlated, and as such, we are unable to see a latent variable structure. In conclusion, we will continue using the eleven theory-based factors previously described for the rest of our analysis."
